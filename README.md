 2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5 and from he data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
