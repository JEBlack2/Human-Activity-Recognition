## Assignment: 
Given the project data provided at: 
  * https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5) and from he data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
## Given: 
 * The referenced zip file has been downloaded and unziped into a subdirectory "/UCI HAR Dataset/"
 * This can be accomplished outside of the "R" environment using common systems utility programs.
